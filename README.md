# The Millionaire Quiz App

We will try to implement the Millionaire quiz game using ReactJS framework, for learning purposes during "Lemon Mint boot camp".
The repo contains only the basic application structure and some initial functionality.

Every course participant should fork this repo and try to implement the complete game. The game should look like and have the structure similar to the popular "Millionaire" quiz, but deviations from the rules or new ideas are OK. Use your imagination :)

## The goals

### Architecture

Quality application needs a clean architecture. We will take special care on how the app is structured.

### Looks

The user interface is an important part of every app, so you should pay special attention to how your app looks. Try to make it pretty :)

### Code quality

We will take care about how our code looks, strive to write code that is understandable, that can easily be read by someone else (or ourselves), and, equally important, write code that is correct :)

## How to start

- fork this repo
- clone your fork
- `yarn install`
- `yarn start`

do your thing!

COMMIT EARLY AND COMMIT OFTEN!
